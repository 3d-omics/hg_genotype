A Snakemake workflow for  Short Variant Discovery in Host Genomes


## Usage

- Test that it works:
  - Make sure you have installed `snakemake>=8`
  - Run the pipeline: `snakemake --use-conda --profile profile/default --jobs 100`. It will download all the necesary software through conda. It should take less than 5 minutes.

- Run it with your own data:
  - Edit `config/samples.tsv` and add your samples and where are they located.
  - Edit `config/features.yml` with information regarding the reference you are using.
  - Run the pipeline: `snakemake --use-conda --profile profile/default --jobs 8 all`.
  - If you are in a cluster with slurm, add `--executor slurm`.

## Features

- FASTQ processing with `fastp`.
- Mapping with `bwa-mem2`
- SAM/BAM/CRAM processing with `samtools` and `GATK`.
- SNP calling with `GATK4`.
- SNP annotation with `VEP`
- Sample swap detection with `somalier`.
- Reporting with `MultiQC`.
